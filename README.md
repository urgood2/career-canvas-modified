  tagline = "Your Tagline"
  location = "Your Location"
  email = "your.email@example.com"
  profile_image = "/images/your-profile.jpg"
  description = "Your description"
  author = "Your Name"

  # Social Media
  linkedin_url = "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile"
  github_url = "https://github.com/yourusername"

  # Resume/CV
  resume_url_en = "/files/your-resume-en.pdf"  # Path to English resume

  resume_label = "Full Resume"

  # Social Icons
  [[params.social]]
    icon = "linkedin-in"
    url = "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile"

  [[params.social]]
    icon = "github"
    url = "https://github.com/yourusername"
```

## Menu Configuration

```toml
[[menu.main]]
  name = "About"
  url = "/#about"
  weight = 2

[[menu.main]]
  name = "Skills"
  url = "/#skills"
  weight = 3

[[menu.main]]
  name = "Experience"
  url = "/#experience"
  weight = 4

[[menu.main]]
  name = "Contact"
  url = "/#contact"
  weight = 5
```

## Image Galleries

The theme includes a gallery shortcode for showcasing your work:

```markdown
{{< gallery dir="images/your-gallery" >}}
```

## 🚀 Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command runs `hugo server -D`, which starts a local server and includes draft content (content with `draft: true` in the front matter). This is useful for previewing unpublished or in-progress content during development.

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`

## 🏗️ Building

To build the site for production, you need to:

1. Build the CSS with Tailwind:
   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

2. Build the site with Hugo:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

Or you can do both in one command:
```bash
npm run build:css && npm run build
```

The built site will be in the `public/` directory.

Note: The CSS build step is necessary because the site uses Tailwind CSS, which needs to be processed to generate the final CSS file with only the used styles.
